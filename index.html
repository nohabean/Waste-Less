    <h2 class="revealable">Over 66 million tons of food is wasted in the US each year</h2>

    <div class="about-text">
      <p class="revealable">
        Food waste in the United States is a multifaceted challenge that transcends its environmental implications, touching on economic, social, and ethical dimensions. Recent data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) underscores the sheer magnitude of the issue, revealing that in 2018, over 66 million tons of food were discarded from the residential, food retail, and food service sectors, with an additional 40 million tons originating from food manufacturing and processing. This staggering volume not only represents a significant economic loss in terms of resources invested in cultivation, processing, and transportation but also exacerbates issues of food insecurity. While vast quantities of edible food end up in landfills, many individuals and families across the nation struggle to access sufficient and nutritious meals, highlighting the urgent need for a more efficient and equitable distribution system.
      </p>
    
      <p class="revealable">
        Beyond its socioeconomic impact, food waste exacts a toll on the environment, contributing to climate change, resource depletion, and increased landfill emissions. The production and disposal of wasted food generate a substantial carbon footprint, accounting for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental consequences extend further, with extensive use of water, energy, and agricultural land to produce food that ultimately goes uneaten. Addressing the issue requires a comprehensive approach involving individuals, businesses, and policymakers to implement sustainable practices, innovative solutions, and awareness campaigns that reshape consumption patterns and foster a culture of responsible and mindful food management.

        <h3 class="revealable">Economic Impacts</h3>
        <p class="revealable">
          Wasting food also affects the price of food. When there's more waste, prices go up, making it harder for people with less money to buy food. The global value of wasted food is about $1,000 billion each year, and it goes up to $2,600 billion if we include hidden environmental costs.

        <h3 class="revealable">Environmental Impacts</h3>
        <p class="revealable">
          The environmental impacts of food waste are substantial, contributing to global warming through the release of harmful methane gas from decomposing food in landfills. The distribution and disposal of food over long distances also contribute to environmental harm, requiring significant fuel consumption and emissions. Addressing food waste is crucial for global food security and supply, as unsustainable practices lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and waste production.

        <h3 class="revealable">Social Impacts</h3>
        <p class="revealable">
          Despite sufficient global food production, nearly a billion people suffer from hunger and malnutrition. Developed countries discard tons of still-good quality and safe food that could alleviate hunger in developing nations. Similar issues exist within developed countries, where certain populations have surplus access to food while socially weaker groups struggle to afford quality or sufficient food. At the European level, up to 50% of edible and harmless food is unnecessarily wasted annually, according to the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture. This occurs in homes, supermarkets, restaurants, and throughout the food chain, while millions of citizens live below the poverty line and depend on food aid.
